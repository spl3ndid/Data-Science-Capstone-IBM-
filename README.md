# ðŸš€ Applied Data Science Capstone

This Capstone marks the culmination of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization, encapsulating and applying the knowledge acquired throughout the 10-course journey.

## ðŸ“„ Project Background
SpaceX, a trailblazer in the commercial space industry, has revolutionized space travel with its cost-effective solutions. The Falcon 9 rocket, priced at $62 million, boasts reusability, a key factor in cost reduction. This project aims to predict the reusability of SpaceX's first stage by leveraging machine learning models based on publicly available information.

## ðŸ“„ Questions to be Answered
1. How do variables such as payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbits influence the success of the first stage landing?
2. Does the success rate of landings exhibit an upward trend over the years?
3. Which algorithm proves most effective for binary classification in this context?

## ðŸ“„ Methodology
1. **Data Collection Methodology**
   - Utilized SpaceX Rest API
   - Employed Web Scraping from Wikipedia

2. **Data Wrangling**
   - Filtered and curated the data
   - Addressed missing values
   - Applied One Hot Encoding for binary classification preparation

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Employed visualization techniques and SQL for in-depth analysis

4. **Interactive Visual Analytics**
   - Leveraged Folium and Plotly Dash for interactive exploration

5. **Predictive Analysis**
   - Implemented classification models
   - Fine-tuned and evaluated models for optimal performance

This comprehensive approach not only provides insights into SpaceX's first stage reusability but also showcases the practical application of data science methodologies in solving real-world challenges.
