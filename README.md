# Data-Science-Capstone-IBM

ðŸš€ Applied Data Science Capstone
This Capstone marks the culmination of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization, encapsulating and applying the knowledge acquired throughout the 10-course journey.

ðŸ“„ Project Background
SpaceX, a trailblazer in the commercial space industry, has revolutionized space travel with its cost-effective solutions. The Falcon 9 rocket, priced at $62 million, boasts reusability, a key factor in cost reduction. This project aims to predict the reusability of SpaceX's first stage by leveraging machine learning models based on publicly available information.

ðŸ“„ Questions to be Answered
How do variables such as payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbits influence the success of the first stage landing?
Does the success rate of landings exhibit an upward trend over the years?
Which algorithm proves most effective for binary classification in this context?
